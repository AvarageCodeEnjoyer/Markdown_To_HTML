<h1>Important Notice</h1>
<p><strong>The user of this software assumes ALL LIABILITY for lost or corrupted files.</strong></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Before you use the script, you will need to install Python on the host machine, just click on <code>Download Python.bat</code> and it will take you to the python download page. The first time you run <code>Encrypt.py</code>, it will start installing <code>cryptography.Fernet</code> and <code>tkinter</code>. Just run the script a second time after it finishes installing for it to work.</p>
<h2>!!WARNING!!</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT LOSE THE KEYS:</strong> If you lose the keys to the encryption, you WILL LOSE THE FILES.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT CHANGE FOLDER PATHS OF ENCRYPTED FILES:</strong> This script works by saving the path of the selected folder, so if you change the path, the script won&#39;t be able to find the folder.</li>
<li><strong>Do not change the files paths within the app.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Before updating your local script make sure you have no encrypted files</strong> You will lose your keys and the files or the Decrypt script may not be compatible with a previous version.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommended Use Case</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have the script on a USB drive so you can keep the keys somewhere safe.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can start the <code>startApp.bat</code>, a shortcut on the desktop, and keep the software on your computer.</li>
<li>Try to keep encryptions relatively small to minimize the chance of failure.</li>
<li>Make sure to have a backup when you encrypt files.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Encrypting Files</h2>
<p>To encrypt files, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start <code>startApp.bat</code>.</li>
<li>Press &quot;E&quot; to start <code>Encrypt.py</code>.</li>
<li>Select a folder from the file explorer, and the files inside the folder will start encrypting.<ul>
<li>This process only encrypts files inside folders so you must select a folder; it will iterate over all files and directories inside the selected folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once encryption is complete, the script will list all the files that have been encrypted.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Decrypting Files</h2>
<p>To decrypt files, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start <code>startApp.bat</code>.</li>
<li>Press &quot;D&quot; to start <code>Decrypt.py</code>.</li>
<li>A CMD prompt will pop up, asking you to input the corresponding number to the folder you decrypted.</li>
<li>The script will list all the files that have been decrypted.</li>
<li>Press Enter, and you&#39;re done!</li>
</ol>
